# Day 4 - Repository Infrastructure Recovery & Git 
Troubleshooting

Date: September 21, 2025
Duration: ~3 hours
Focus: Critical infrastructure fixes, systematic 
problem-solving, Git recovery techniques

## Initial Problem Assessment

### Critical Issue Identified
Problem: All directory links in main README returning 404 
errors
Impact: Complete loss of repository credibility for 
recruiter evaluation
Root Cause: Promised directories referenced in README did 
not exist
Severity: Critical - undermines entire portfolio 
presentation

### Missing Infrastructure
- /hardware → 404 error
- /networking → 404 error  
- /proxmox → 404 error
- /development → 404 error
- /labs → 404 error
- /scripts → 404 error
- /leadership → 404 error

## Git Troubleshooting Lessons Learned

### Issue 1: Work Loss During Development
Symptom: Created directories and files, made commits, but 
work disappeared
Debugging Process:
1. Verified branch creation with git branch
2. Checked commit history with git log --oneline
3. Confirmed working directory location with pwd

Root Cause: Branch management confusion and working 
directory navigation errors
Resolution Applied: Systematic recreation with careful 
verification at each step

### Issue 2: Commit Success But Files Not Visible
Symptom: git log showed successful commits but ls -la showed 
missing directories
Debugging Commands Used:
git show --name-only HEAD        # Verify commit contents
git ls-tree -r HEAD | grep README  # List actual files in 
commit
git reset --hard HEAD           # Force working directory 
sync

Root Cause: Inconsistency between Git index and working 
directory
Resolution: git reset --hard HEAD synchronized local 
filesystem with Git repository

### Issue 3: Files Committed to Wrong Location
Symptom: Files committed to services/hardware/ instead of 
hardware/
Detection: git ls-tree -r HEAD revealed incorrect paths
Resolution: Used mv commands to relocate directories, then 
Git recognized as renames

## Git Commands Mastered Today

### Troubleshooting Commands
Command | Purpose | When to Use
git show --name-only HEAD | View files in last commit | 
Verify commit contents without file details
git ls-tree -r HEAD | List all files in repository | Debug 
missing files or wrong locations
git reset --hard HEAD | Force sync working directory | Fix 
file visibility issues
git log --oneline -n | Compact commit history | Quick 
repository status check
pwd | Verify current location | Prevent working directory 
confusion

### Branch and Commit Management
Command | Purpose | Learning Point
git checkout -b branch-name | Create and switch to new 
branch | Always verify branch creation with git branch
git add . | Stage all changes | Verify with git status 
before commit
git status | Check repository state | Essential before every 
major Git operation
git commit -m "message" | Commit with message | Use 
multi-line format for substantial changes

## Problem-Solving Methodology Applied

### Systematic Troubleshooting Approach
1. Problem Definition: Identify exact symptoms and scope
2. Information Gathering: Use Git commands to understand 
current state
3. Hypothesis Formation: Develop theories about root cause
4. Testing: Apply targeted solutions and verify results
5. Documentation: Record solutions for future reference

### Intel Seven Steps Application to Git Issues
1. Define the problem clearly: Repository links broken, work 
disappearing
2. Describe in detail: Specific symptoms and error patterns
3. Identify possible causes: Branch confusion, working 
directory issues, sync problems
4. Test to determine actual cause: Systematic Git debugging 
commands
5. Develop action plan: Recreation strategy with 
verification steps
6. Implement corrective action: Systematic directory 
creation and documentation
7. Monitor for effectiveness: Verify all links functional 
and content accessible

## Documentation Standards Established

### Enterprise-Level Approach
- Comprehensive Coverage: Each directory includes current 
state, planning, and roadmap
- Honest Assessment: Realistic capability evaluation vs fake 
expertise claims
- Strategic Planning: JONSBO case integration shows 
forward-thinking approach
- Professional Format: Consistent structure and technical 
depth

### Content Quality Metrics
- Hardware Documentation: ~50 lines with current inventory + 
expansion planning
- Networking Documentation: ~80 lines with topology + VLAN 
strategy
- Development Documentation: ~70 lines with vehicle project 
technical details
- Leadership Documentation: ~90 lines with three-role 
progression analysis

## Critical Learning Points

### Git Workflow Reliability
Key Insight: Verify each step of Git workflow before 
proceeding to next
Implementation: 
- Always run git status before and after major operations
- Confirm branch location with git branch 
- Verify commits immediately with git log --oneline -1
- Use pwd to confirm working directory location

### Repository Credibility Management
Principle: Never promise documentation without delivering it
Application: Every link in README must lead to substantial 
content
Result: Transform credibility liability into professional 
demonstration

### Systematic Problem Recovery
Approach: When work is lost, systematic recreation is more 
efficient than panic
Method: Use previous experience to recreate content faster 
and better
Benefit: Second iteration often produces higher quality 
results

## Business and Career Value

## Reflection and Lessons Learned

### Technical Troubleshooting
Git issues provided valuable learning opportunity for 
systematic problem-solving under pressure. The experience of 
losing work multiple times and successfully recovering 
demonstrates resilience and systematic approach to technical 
challenges.

### Professional Development
Repository infrastructure recovery showcases ability to 
identify critical issues, develop systematic solutions, and 
deliver professional results under time constraints. This 
experience directly translates to DevOps operational 
challenges.

### Portfolio Strategy
Transforming broken repository infrastructure into 
comprehensive documentation demonstrates the same systematic 
approach and attention to detail required for production 
infrastructure management. The honest assessment approach 
builds credibility more effectively than overstated 
capabilities.
