## STEP 1: DEFINE THE PROBLEM

### Problem Definition
**Initial State**: Basic homelab with minimal documentation, 
no professional GitHub presence, informal technical skill 
presentation.

**Desired State**: Professional GitHub portfolio 
demonstrating:
- Technical competency through real infrastructure 
documentation
- Systematic development approach and learning journey
- Professional documentation standards matching enterprise 
expectations
- Evidence of practical problem-solving and implementation 
skills

**Gap Analysis**: 
- No structured documentation of existing infrastructure
- Lack of professional Git workflow demonstration
- Missing evidence of technical skill progression
- No systematic approach to portfolio development

### Success Criteria
- Professional service documentation (enterprise-level 
standards)
- Functional Git workflow with feature branches and Pull 
Requests
- Organized learning progression documentation
- Repository structure supporting career transition 
narrative

## STEP 2: DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM IN DETAIL

### Current Infrastructure (Baseline)
**Hardware Assets**:
- Intel NUC 5i3RYK: Proxmox host (16GB DDR3L, 500GB SSD)
- Intel NUC 6i5SYK: VMware development (16GB DDR4, 500GB 
SSD)  
- Raspberry Pi 2: OMV NAS (1GB RAM, 2TB USB3 SSD)
- Dell PowerEdge T320, T110 II: Standby expansion servers

**Active Services**:
- Pi-hole LXC: DNS filtering (deployed ~1 year ago, recently 
reactivated)
- Transmission LXC: BitTorrent client with OMV integration
- GNS3 VM: Network simulation for CCNA practice
- pfSense VM: Virtual firewall learning environment
- Plex Media Server: Local streaming on OMV

**Documentation State**:
- Basic service descriptions only
- No systematic organization
- Minimal technical depth
- No professional presentation standards

### Skills Assessment (Honest Evaluation)
**Technical Competencies**:
- Virtualization: Proxmox (Intermediate), VMware 
(Basic-Intermediate)
- Linux: Ubuntu/CentOS/Debian (Basic-Intermediate)
- Networking: CCNA theory in progress, flat network practice 
only
- Development: Python basic, Bash scripting basic
- Git: Professional workflow mastered during analysis period

**Professional Background**:
- Intel Corporation: Process engineering, team training, 
systematic methodology
- Tecnorótulos: 17-year business ownership, project 
management
- Current role: Logistics coordination, cultural 
transformation leadership

### Portfolio Development Challenges
**Technical Barriers**:
- Limited advanced networking implementation
- No containerization/orchestration in production
- Monitoring and automation gaps
- Documentation time constraints (1 hour daily available)

**Professional Barriers**:
- Need to demonstrate competency without overstating 
capabilities
- Balance learning journey transparency with professional 
credibility
- Show systematic development approach vs random 
experimentation

---

## STEP 3: IDENTIFY POSSIBLE CAUSES

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Contributing Factors**:

1. **Lack of Systematic Documentation Approach**
   - Infrastructure developed organically over time
   - No enterprise documentation standards applied
   - Missing structured learning progression tracking

2. **Insufficient Professional Git Workflow**
   - Basic Git usage without feature branch methodology
   - No Pull Request workflow for documentation changes
   - Missing professional commit message standards

3. **Unclear Portfolio Strategy**
   - No defined target audience (recruiters/hiring managers)
   - Unclear differentiation from typical homelab portfolios
   - Missing connection between technical skills and career 
objectives

4. **Time and Resource Constraints**
   - Limited daily availability for portfolio development
   - Need to maintain current job performance
   - Hardware budget limitations for expansion

**Secondary Contributing Factors**:
- Perfectionism preventing initial documentation publication
- Uncertainty about appropriate technical depth for target 
roles
- Lack of visual evidence (screenshots, diagrams, topology 
maps)

## STEP 4: TEST TO DETERMINE ACTUAL CAUSE

### Hypothesis Testing Process

**Hypothesis 1**: "Documentation quality is the primary 
barrier to professional portfolio"
**Test Method**: Implement enterprise-level documentation 
for one service (Pi-hole)
**Result**: Creating comprehensive Pi-hole documentation 
(156 lines) immediately elevated repository professional 
appearance
**Conclusion**: CONFIRMED - Documentation quality 
significantly impacts professional credibility

**Hypothesis 2**: "Git workflow sophistication demonstrates 
professional competency"
**Test Method**: Implement feature branch → Pull Request → 
squash merge workflow
**Result**: Professional workflow created clear evidence of 
systematic development approach
**Conclusion**: CONFIRMED - Git workflow quality directly 
correlates with perceived professional competency

**Hypothesis 3**: "Learning journey transparency vs 
expertise claims affects recruiter perception"
**Test Method**: Document honest skill assessment and 
learning objectives vs claiming advanced expertise
**Result**: Honest approach with clear development plans 
appears more credible than overstated capabilities
**Conclusion**: CONFIRMED - Transparency with systematic 
improvement planning is more valuable than fake expertise

**Hypothesis 4**: "Time constraints prevent systematic 
portfolio development"
**Test Method**: Implement structured 1-2 hour daily 
sessions with specific objectives
**Result**: Significant progress achieved in 3 days with 
focused approach
**Conclusion**: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED - Time constraints exist 
but systematic approach maximizes efficiency
