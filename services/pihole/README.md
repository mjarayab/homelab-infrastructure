# Pi-hole DNS Filtering Service

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Configuration and Optimization  
**Deployment Date**: ~1 year ago (following tutorial setup)  
**Recent Reactivation**: September 2025 (1 week operational)  
**Learning Objective**: Customize configuration for specific 
homelab needs  
**Documentation Goal**: Professional service management 
practices

## Initial Implementation

### Setup Background
- **Original Installation**: ~1 year ago following online 
tutorial
- **Configuration State**: Basic default setup (minimal 
customization)
- **Operational Period**: Initial testing phase, then 
dormant for months
- **Reactivation Reason**: Homelab professional development 
and learning

### Current Infrastructure
- **Host Platform**: Proxmox VE on Intel NUC 5i3RYK
- **Container Type**: LXC (Linux Container)
- **Basic Configuration**: Default Pi-hole installation
- **Network Integration**: Connected to flat network 
(192.168.1.0/24)

## Learning Objectives

### Configuration Goals
- [ ] **Custom Blocking Lists**: Research and implement 
security-focused lists
- [ ] **Household Optimization**: Configure for family usage 
patterns
- [ ] **Network Integration**: Proper DNS configuration with 
router
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baseline metrics 
and monitoring

### Skills Development
- [ ] **Pi-hole Administration**: Master dashboard and CLI 
management
- [ ] **DNS Configuration**: Understand upstream DNS 
optimization
- [ ] **Service Monitoring**: Implement operational health 
checks
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Develop systematic 
problem-solving procedures

## Current Configuration Status

### Known Configuration
- **Installation Method**: Standard Pi-hole installation 
script
- **Web Interface**: Basic dashboard access functional
- **Default Settings**: Minimal modification from tutorial 
setup
- **Network Status**: Service responding, basic 
functionality confirmed

### Configuration Gaps (Learning Opportunities)
- **Custom Block Lists**: Using default lists only
- **Upstream DNS**: Default configuration (needs 
optimization)
- **Client Integration**: Manual DNS setting (automation 
needed)
- **Monitoring**: No systematic health checking implemented

## Planned Implementation

### Phase 1: Assessment and Documentation (Current)
- [ ] **Service Audit**: Document current configuration 
state
- [ ] **Performance Baseline**: Establish metrics for 
improvement tracking
- [ ] **Network Analysis**: Map current DNS flow and 
dependencies
- [ ] **Learning Plan**: Research best practices and 
optimization techniques

### Phase 2: Configuration Optimization
- [ ] **Block List Research**: Implement security-focused 
blocking lists
- [ ] **Upstream DNS**: Configure optimal upstream DNS 
servers
- [ ] **Router Integration**: Automate client DNS 
configuration
- [ ] **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for household usage 
patterns

### Phase 3: Operational Excellence
- [ ] **Monitoring Implementation**: Systematic health 
checking procedures
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Configuration backup and recovery 
procedures
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete operational runbook 
development
- [ ] **Maintenance Schedule**: Establish regular update and 
review cycles
